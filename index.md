## Automated Posture Analysis and Similarity Statistics

Our project aims at providing a comparison and analysis between two people performing a similar task.  We would analyse the movements of the 2 individuals using computer vision. 
This application has great usage especially when it comes to areas which require physical training. For example, when it comes to sports or dance, coaches can pre-record a video and trainees can practice it out.
We then collect the feed from the users, process it and report the similarities and differences for further improvement. 
A service like this ensures that people can continue their fitness regime without facing postural difficulties and sore backs.
